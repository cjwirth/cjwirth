I'm a software guy based in Tokyo, Japan.

As a Software Engineer at [CyberAgent, Inc.]<sup>([English])</sup>, I spend my days working on iOS apps. And yes, all my day-to-day work is done in Japanese :)

I am currently working on [AbemaTV], a live video streaming service that should be out in Spring 2016!

## Tools

This is where I list buzzwords of technologies I've worked with:

- Swift, Objective-C, Cocoa, iOS
- Go
- nginx, AWS, Ansible
- Java, Android
- MySQL, PostgreSQL, Redis
- PHP

I have also recently taken an interest in functional programming languages such as Haskell and Scala.

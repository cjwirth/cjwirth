I'm a software guy based in Tokyo, Japan.

As a Software Engineer at [CyberAgent, Inc.]<sup>([English])</sup>, I spend my days working on iOS apps. And yes, all my day-to-day work is done in Japanese :)

My current project is the [iOS companion app](https://itunes.apple.com/en/app/id911640835) to [Ameba Ownd]. It aims to be the easiest way for anyone to set up and manage their own stylish website.

## Tools

This is where I list buzzwords of technologies I've worked with:

- Swift, Objective-C, Cocoa, iOS
- Go
- nginx, AWS, Ansible
- Java, Android
- MySQL, PostgreSQL, Redis
- PHP

I have also recently taken an interest in functional programming languages such as Haskell and Scala.

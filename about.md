I'm a software engineer, husband and dad, and all-around person based in Berlin, Germany.

As a Software Engineer at [Duolingo], I currently co-lead a team focused on enabling engineers on iOS can build stable, performant, and well-tested features by using consistent and scalable architectural patterns.

title: Hello, World!
---

This is the first post on this new blog. It is titled "Hello, World" because of course it is. Being a blog that is mainly about programming, it seems only fitting to keep to tradition.

<!--excerpt-->

 That is, when beginning a new programming language, the first program you learn to write always prints out "Hello, World!" So this blog also prints out "Hello, World!" as its starting post.

For those of you just tuning in, I am a Software Enginner currently living in Tokyo, Japan. I work on iOS apps. This is where I will write about programming topics that I find interesting, solutions to problems I've come across, and pretty much anything else related.

So stay awhile, and listen!
